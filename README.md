# angularjs-sidebar
A simple Angular sidebar

**Specs**

* Html
* CSS
* Javascript (not ES6)
* JQuery
* AngularJS
* ngRoute (AngularJS module)
* Bootstrap
* Bower
* Grunt
* npm

**Installation**

* Download
* `npm install`
* `bower install`

**Usage**

* The sidebar consists on two directives. One for the sidebar itself and one for the navigators.
* As it was created with ngRoute, it can be used as a template to start an Angular project really fast.
* The navigators are passed as an array to the sidebar directive. It can be done as attributes (maybe you would like to have different navigators in each view) or it can be defined in the controller (if you would like to have the same navigators in each view).
